Yet, what if that is actually an expression of blindness? What if the one who truly sees is the one who we least expect? Who doesn't look that fancy, but trusts in God's power to change them? 'Blindness' exposes our assumptions as we journey with a blind man who 'sees', desperate for those who are 'blind' to truly see.\n",

While an educational-style voice-over discusses the science and art of flight, the characters, like airplanes themselves, take off, struggle to fly, and eventually come in for an emergency landing.\n",

But the protagonist has his own ideas and strategies to escape his reality. Thus, the author has no other choice but to dismiss the fictional level, and to attempt to approach the character of his aim from a documentary point of view.\n",

By capturing the essence of each animal, Daniel and his team of three (Fred, Joseph and Dixie) give their clients' pets a loving and lasting alternative to cremation or burial.\n"
