High school student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) finds herself the victim of her school's \"rumor mill\" when she lies to her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) about a weekend tryst with a fictional college freshman. Word quickly spreads of Olive's promiscuity and, much to her surprise, she welcomes the attention. When she agrees to help out a bullied friend by pretending to sleep with him, her image rapidly degrades to a more lascivious state and her world begins to spin out of control. As she helps more and more of her classmates and her lies continue to escalate, Olive must find a way to save face before the school's religious fanatic Marianne (Amanda Bynes) gets her expelled and she loses a shot at attaining her own happiness. In California, the virgin student Olive Penderghast feels anonymous in the high school where she studies. When her best friend Rhiannon invites her to spend the weekend with her family, Olive lies and tells that she will have a date with a nonexistent community college student. On the next Monday, Rhiannon goes to the bathroom with Olive and asks how her encounter was and Olive lies, telling that she lost her virginity in the weekend with her fictitious boyfriend. However, one school mate overhears their conversation and spreads the rumor about Olive's promiscuity. The religious fanatic Marianne blames her and out of the blue. Olive becomes a notorious student. Meanwhile, Olive is studying \"The Scarlet Letter\" in the English class and she identifies herself like Hester Prynne, the woman condemned by her Puritan neighbors in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel.

Jeremy and his gang beat up T in the back parking lot of the school, threatening to kill him if he touches Olive again. T, battered and bruised, goes home to his Mother, who reveals that he has received a scholarship for University. Bree and Ash go to see Doctor Chang, where it is confirmed that Bree also has Chlamydia. Bree takes the news badly. Jeremy then confronts Olive, slapping her, and leaving her on the side of the road.

      "A look at a seemingly placid New England town that is actually wrought with illicit affairs, crime and tragedy, all told through the lens of Olive, whose wicked wit and harsh demeanor mask a warm but troubled heart and staunch moral center. The story spans 25 years and focuses on Olive's relationships with her husband, Henry, the good-hearted and kindly town pharmacist; their son, Christopher, who resents his mother's approach to parenting; and other members of their community. Outspoken middle school teacher Olive has a complex relationship with husband Henry, a good-hearted, selfless pharmacist. She is very critical, and he finds her harsh and hurtful, yet each has traits the other adores, but their son, Christopher, resents her behavior and hates his dad being a victim. The program depicts life in a coastal town and the affects of mental illness. Olive Kitteridge is a misanthropic and strict, but well-meaning, retired schoolteacher who lives in the fictional seaside town of Crosby, Maine. She is married to Henry Kitteridge, a kind, considerate man who runs a pharmacy downtown, and has a troubled son named Christopher, who grows up to be a podiatrist. For 25 years, Olive has experienced problems of depression, bereavement, jealousy, and friction with family members and friends. Both Olive and Frank are saddened when they receive a call from Christopher, now living in California, to say that he and Suzanne are getting a divorce. He also makes it clear that he won't be coming home anytime soon. The need for an urgent trip to bathroom find Olive stopping in at the local hospital to use their facilities but leads to something far more serious when two gun-toting addicts arrive looking for drugs. It leads to Olive and Henry having a major argument, blaming each other for Christopher having left home. She also reveals that she was once going to leave him. Christopher suggests they have counseling after their ordeal but Olive won't hear of it. After Henry suffers a stroke some months later, he is in home care. Christopher tells his mother just what he thinks of his childhood. The years have passed and Kevin Coulson, now studying to be a psychiatrist, returns to town. He still has issues over his mother Rachel's suicide and has his own mental health issues to deal with. Olive's son Christopher is about to marry and she invites Kevin to attend the rehearsal dinner they're having that night. Not surprisingly, Olive dislikes her future daughter-in-law, Suzanne, as well as her prospective in-laws. She invites Kevin to stay with them and invite him to the wedding the next day which has a few problems of its own. Olive Kitteridge is a no-nonsense high school math teacher who doesn't stand fools gladly and never hesitates to express an opinion, no matter how much hurt she might cause. She treats her husband Henry with indifference and is downright nasty to her son Christopher who can never please her. Henry is the local pharmacist and after his long-time assistant dies from a stroke he hires a quiet young woman, Denise Thibodeau, whose husband is also called Henry. The two Henrys go hunting with a third man but tragedy strikes. The only person Olive can seemingly be nice to is Kevin Coulson, whose mother Rachel suffers from bipolar disorder. Olive visits Christopher and his new wife Ann in New York City but relations continue to be strained. She likes Ann more than she liked Christopher's first wife but is still at her judgmental worse when it comes to Ann's two children from previous relationships or her housekeeping skills. When she decides to leave and he doesn't try to stop her she accuses him of forcing her out. It leads to another bout of accusations all around with Olive refusing to understand just how horrible a mother she was. She returns home to bad news. Some 6 months later the widowed Olive meets Jack Kennison, a widower, and they find a way to go forward together.\n",

      "After a little white lie about losing her virginity gets out, a clean cut high school girl sees her life paralleling Hester Prynne's in \"The Scarlet Letter,\" which she is currently studying in school - until she decides to use the rumor mill to advance her social and financial standing. High school student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) finds herself the victim of her school's \"rumor mill\" when she lies to her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) about a weekend tryst with a fictional college freshman. Word quickly spreads of Olive's promiscuity and, much to her surprise, she welcomes the attention. When she agrees to help out a bullied friend by pretending to sleep with him, her image rapidly degrades to a more lascivious state and her world begins to spin out of control. As she helps more and more of her classmates and her lies continue to escalate, Olive must find a way to save face before the school's religious fanatic Marianne (Amanda Bynes) gets her expelled and she loses a shot at attaining her own happiness. In California, the virgin student Olive Penderghast feels anonymous in the high school where she studies. When her best friend Rhiannon invites her to spend the weekend with her family, Olive lies and tells that she will have a date with a nonexistent community college student. On the next Monday, Rhiannon goes to the bathroom with Olive and asks how her encounter was and Olive lies, telling that she lost her virginity in the weekend with her fictitious boyfriend. However, one school mate overhears their conversation and spreads the rumor about Olive's promiscuity. The religious fanatic Marianne blames her and out of the blue. Olive becomes a notorious student. Meanwhile, Olive is studying \"The Scarlet Letter\" in the English class and she identifies herself like Hester Prynne, the woman condemned by her Puritan neighbors in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel. Olive discloses the truth to her bullied gay friend Brandon and suggests him to also lie that he had slept with a girl. Brandon asks Olive to help him and she pretends to have sex with him in a party. Then other outcast boys offer to pay Olive to improve their images while Olive's reputation degrades. When Olive loses control of the situation, she needs to take an attitude to revert it.\n",

      "Connecticut high school students Max Doyle and Jessica Carpenter fall in love and feel making love isn't enough, so they brave everyone's objections and get married. Jess gets accepted at Harvard, to pursue her lifelong ambition to become an orthopedic surgeon; Max decides against accepting any other college and waits for another chance to get in, meanwhile taking a job in construction so he can still be together. Still they really spend most time apart, she even sort of falls for fellow student Carter, who is also a gifted guitarist-singer. When Max announces college is no longer his firm resolve, she blames him for changing their plans, too much ingratitude even for his love to swallow... Max Doyle and Jessica Carpenter, in love with each other, are high school seniors in a small Connecticut town. They have their immediate future all planned: they will both attend Harvard after they graduate so that they can be together. Their plan hits a snag when overachieving Jess is accepted into Harvard, but Max's application is deferred, although he is accepted into five other post-secondary institutions, the closest to Harvard being three hundred miles away. This snag leads to an impromptu engagement between the two. They want to emulate Max's parents marriage, they who also married young and are seemingly happy. They also want to show that being older does not guarantee marriage happiness, as Jess' parents are going through a nasty divorce. Their converse argument is that being young and in love will lead to a better marriage than Jess' parents. Despite each set of parents truly liking their potential daughter-in-law or son-in-law, the parents are split on whether to give their blessing to this marriage. It doesn't matter for eighteen year old of-age Max, but underage seventeen year old Jess needs at least one parent to provide consent. If they are able to go through with the marriage, Max and Jess need to decide what to do, their options being to have a long distance relationship, for Jess to forgo Harvard to attend one of Max's schools, or for Max to move to Boston and work in the meantime. Their plan still is for Max to work his way into ultimately getting accepted into Harvard regardless. Will Max and Jess' relationship be able to withstand these pressures, will they be able to prove their naysayers wrong, or are they indeed too young and irresponsible to deal with the more adult issues that go along with marriage?\n",
